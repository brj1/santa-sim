# santa-sim

SANTA is JAVA software application that simulates the evolution of a population of gene sequences
forwards through time. It models the underlying biological processes
as discrete components; replication (including recombination),
mutation (including indels), fitness and selection. SANTA is easy to use and is well-suited to simulate pathogen evolution using different  scenarios.
